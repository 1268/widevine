> More recently, Zhao broke in to the Widevine L1 security level on the
> Qualcomm TEE, an Android TrustZone implementation. The L1 is the most secure
> implementation of Widevine, which uses TEEs on user devices to protect
> content and encryption keys, and to securely decrypt content. Zhao recovered
> the Widevine keybox from the trusted storage of QTEE by breaking the ASLR
> (Address Space Layout Randomization).
